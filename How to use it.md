# Implementation and Usage Guide for Network Privacy Tool

## Project Structure
I've organized the TypeScript implementation with the following structure:

```
network-privacy-tool/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts            # Main entry point
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── colors.ts       # Terminal color utilities
│   │   └── system.ts       # System detection utilities
│   └── services/
│       ├── ip.ts           # IP address utilities
│       └── mac.ts          # MAC address utilities
├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Cross-platform Support**
   - Windows and Unix-like systems detection
   - System-specific commands for each platform

2. **MAC Address Management**
   - Get current MAC address
   - Change MAC address to random vendor-based or fully random MAC
   - Revert to permanent MAC address

3. **IP Address Management**
   - Get internal IP address
   - Get external IP address
   - Renew IP address

4. **User Interface**
   - Colorful terminal output
   - ASCII art logo (like the original tool)
   - Command line arguments using Commander.js

## How to Set Up and Use

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- On Windows: Admin privileges
- On Unix-like systems: Root privileges and macchanger utility

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or create the project structure as shown above
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the TypeScript code:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Run the tool with appropriate privileges:
```bash
# On Windows (run as Administrator)
npm start

# On Unix-like systems
sudo npm start
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage
Running the tool without any arguments will:
1. Display your current MAC and IP addresses
2. Renew your IP address
3. Change your MAC address to a random one
4. Display your new MAC and IP addresses

```bash
sudo npm start
```

### Revert MAC Address
To revert your MAC address to its permanent hardware address:

```bash
sudo npm run revert
```

### Specify Network Interface
By default, the tool uses "eth0" as the network interface. To specify a different interface:

```bash
sudo npm start -- --interface wlan0
```

## Implementation Notes

### Handling System Commands
The tool uses Node.js `child_process.exec()` to run system commands, which requires elevated privileges for network operations.

### Error Handling
Each network operation has error handling to gracefully handle failures in different environments.

### MAC Address Generation
The tool attempts to use vendor lists if available, falling back to fully random MAC generation if needed.

### Configuration
The Commander.js library provides a clean way to handle command-line arguments and options.

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Add network interface detection**
   - Auto-detect available interfaces instead of hard-coding "eth0"

2. **Improve error handling**
   - More specific error messages for different scenarios
   - Guided troubleshooting for common issues

3. **Add configuration file**
   - Allow users to save preferred settings

4. **Add logging**
   - Keep history of MAC and IP changes

5. **Add 100% test coverage**

5. **Make it into a component for other applications**


### For future updates:

1. **Add GUI for single use**
   - Create an Electron-based GUI for easier use

2. **Enhanced privacy features**
   - Add VPN integration
   - Add DNS leak protection
   - Add browser fingerprint protection
